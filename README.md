# Dungeon-Crawler
Minecraft-themed dungeon crawler made visual using curses library.

This is my favorite project I have ever created. However, much to my disappointment, it no longer works. I believe curses (the framework I was using) has fallen out of date and all of my attempts to use older versions of python have failed.

I mostly leave this up for posterity. This took a long time to make, and curses was very difficult to learn. Curses was originally made for old-school terminals to have more visual elements before GUIs were widespread. You can imagine how many weird quirks and features it had as a result of being so old.

This was created for my Programming 1 midterm while I was in community college, and like I said, it is my favorite thing I have ever made. Many long hours were spent creating this and it saddens me greatly that I can no longer get it to work. I’ve posted it to my github so others can appreciate the time and dedication I spent creating something I am proud of, even if it no longer works.

If you would like to try to get it to work, I wish you luck! I developed this in October of 2020, although I can’t remember what version of python I was using. I developed using a linux environment, so that would be the best way to try to get it to work. Please let me know if you succeed, I would be very grateful!
